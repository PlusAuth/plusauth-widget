# Getting Started
First we need to add the script to our page
```html
<head>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@plusauth/plusauth-widget@0.21.0/dist/plusauth-widget.min.js" type="application/javascript"></script>
</head>
```
After that all we need to initialize the widget like following:
```html
<script >
  new PlusAuthWidget() // will be rendered at document.body
</script>
```

# Configuration

[//]: # (TODO)
